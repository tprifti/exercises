// The \' sequence in the middle of the text to be displayed is called an escape sequence. Here it’s
// a special way of including a single quote in the text because single quotes are usually used to indicate
// where a character constant begins and ends. You can try recompiling the program, relinking it,
// and running it again once you’ve altered the source. With a following wind and a bit of luck you have
// now edited your first program. You’ve written a program using the editor, edited it, and compiled,
// linked, and executed it.
